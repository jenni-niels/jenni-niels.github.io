I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by [Aloni Cohen](https://aloni.net).

My research interests are at the intersection of theoretical computer science, social justice, law and public policy.  Recently I've been thinking about graphs and networks, optimization methods, and differential privacy in the context of the Census, Voting Rights, and Redistricting.  I'm also pasionate about mathematics and civic education/outreach.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a computational engineer at the [MGGG Redistricting Lab](https://www.mggg.org), where I worked on a mixture of academic research projects, software development, and analysis for VRA cases.  I graduated from Tufts University in 2019, where I studied computer science and math.

Outside of academics, I am an avid fan of D&D (and other TTRPGs), baking, houseplants, and cats.  I also enjoy hiking and cycling.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
