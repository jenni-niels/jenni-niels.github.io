### mentoring

From 2013-18 I worked as a math mentor for Girls’ Angle: a Math Club for Girls.  I worked one on one,
or in small groups, with middle school girls, to strengthen their interest in math and develop their
skills in learning how to approach problems and created activities that further exploration of
mathematical concepts.

### teaching

As an undergraduate at Tufts, I was a teaching assistant for two courses within the Computer Science
department.  I held office hours and worked with students to conceptualize and deepen their
understanding of the course material.
